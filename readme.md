# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Dart

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures code using objects, which are instances of classes. Dart fully supports OOP principles, and this section provides a comprehensive exploration of key OOP concepts in Dart.

## Classes and Objects

In Dart, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes and encapsulate data and behavior. Let's expand on the basic example:

```dart
class Animal {
  String name;
  int age;

  Animal(this.name, this.age);

  void makeSound() {
    print('Animal makes a sound');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  String breed;

  Dog(String name, int age, this.breed) : super(name, age);

  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print('Dog barks');
  }

  void showDetails() {
    print('Name: $name, Age: $age, Breed: $breed');
  }
}

void main() {
  // Creating an instance of the Dog class
  var myDog = Dog('Buddy', 3, 'Golden Retriever');

  // Accessing properties
  print('Name: ${myDog.name}, Age: ${myDog.age}, Breed: ${myDog.breed}');

  // Invoking methods
  myDog.makeSound();
  myDog.showDetails();
}
```

In this example, we have an `Animal` class with properties `name` and `age` and a method `makeSound`. The `Dog` class extends `Animal` and introduces an additional property `breed` and a method `showDetails`.

## Constructors

Constructors are special methods used for initializing objects. Dart supports both default and named constructors. Let's extend the previous example to include named constructors:

```dart
class Animal {
  String name;
  int age;

  Animal(this.name, this.age);

  Animal.namedConstructor(this.name) : age = 0;

  void makeSound() {
    print('Animal makes a sound');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  String breed;

  Dog(String name, int age, this.breed) : super(name, age);

  Dog.namedConstructor(String name, String breed)
      : breed = breed,
        super.namedConstructor(name);

  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print('Dog barks');
  }

  void showDetails() {
    print('Name: $name, Age: $age, Breed: $breed');
  }
}

void main() {
  var myDog = Dog('Buddy', 3, 'Golden Retriever');

  var anotherDog = Dog.namedConstructor('Max', 'Labrador');

  myDog.showDetails();
  anotherDog.showDetails();
}
```

Here, we've added named constructors `namedConstructor` to both the `Animal` and `Dog` classes. This allows for alternative ways to construct objects.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The `extends` keyword in Dart is used to implement inheritance. Let's extend our example further:

```dart
class Animal {
  String name;
  int age;

  Animal(this.name, this.age);

  Animal.namedConstructor(this.name) : age = 0;

  void makeSound() {
    print('Animal makes a sound');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  String breed;

  Dog(String name, int age, this.breed) : super(name, age);

  Dog.namedConstructor(String name, String breed)
      : breed = breed,
        super.namedConstructor(name);

  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print('Dog barks');
  }

  void showDetails() {
    print('Name: $name, Age: $age, Breed: $breed');
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  bool hasStripes;

  Cat(String name, int age, this.hasStripes) : super(name, age);

  void makeSound() {
    print('Cat meows');
  }

  void showDetails() {
    print('Name: $name, Age: $age, Has Stripes: $hasStripes');
  }
}

void main() {
  var myDog = Dog('Buddy', 3, 'Golden Retriever');
  var myCat = Cat('Whiskers', 2, true);

  myDog.showDetails();
  myCat.showDetails();
}
```

In this extension, we've introduced a new class `Cat` that also extends `Animal`. The `Cat` class has its own properties and methods, and it overrides the `makeSound` method inherited from `Animal`.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, i.e., a class. Dart supports encapsulation through the use of access modifiers (`public`, `private`, and `protected`). Dart uses an underscore `_` as a convention for marking private members. Let's modify our example to incorporate encapsulation:

```dart
class Animal {
  String _name; // Private property
 

 int _age; // Private property

  Animal(this._name, this._age);

  Animal.namedConstructor(this._name) : _age = 0;

  void makeSound() {
    print('Animal makes a sound');
  }

  // Getter for private property _name
  String get name => _name;

  // Setter for private property _name
  set name(String value) => _name = value;

  // Getter for private property _age
  int get age => _age;

  // Setter for private property _age
  set age(int value) => _age = value;
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  String _breed; // Private property

  Dog(String name, int age, this._breed) : super(name, age);

  Dog.namedConstructor(String name, String breed)
      : _breed = breed,
        super.namedConstructor(name);

  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print('Dog barks');
  }

  void showDetails() {
    print('Name: $name, Age: $age, Breed: $_breed');
  }
}

void main() {
  var myDog = Dog('Buddy', 3, 'Golden Retriever');
  
  // Accessing private properties through getters
  print('Name: ${myDog.name}, Age: ${myDog.age}, Breed: ${myDog.showDetails()}');
}
```

In this example, properties `_name`, `_age`, and `_breed` are marked as private using the underscore `_`. Getters and setters are then used to provide controlled access to these private properties.

## Abstraction

Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. Dart achieves abstraction through abstract classes and methods. Let's create an abstract class and extend it:

```dart
abstract class Shape {
  // Abstract method
  void draw();

  // Regular method
  void getInfo() {
    print('This is a shape.');
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  double radius;

  Circle(this.radius);

  @override
  void draw() {
    print('Drawing a circle with radius $radius');
  }
}

class Square extends Shape {
  double side;

  Square(this.side);

  @override
  void draw() {
    print('Drawing a square with side $side');
  }
}

void main() {
  var myCircle = Circle(5.0);
  var mySquare = Square(4.0);

  myCircle.draw();
  myCircle.getInfo();

  mySquare.draw();
  mySquare.getInfo();
}
```

Here, `Shape` is an abstract class with an abstract method `draw()`. The `Circle` and `Square` classes extend `Shape` and provide their own implementations of the `draw()` method.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. Dart supports polymorphism through method overriding. Let's demonstrate polymorphism using our existing classes:

```dart
void main() {
  Shape myCircle = Circle(5.0);
  Shape mySquare = Square(4.0);

  drawShape(myCircle);
  drawShape(mySquare);
}

void drawShape(Shape shape) {
  shape.draw();
}
```

In this example, `myCircle` and `mySquare` are both treated as `Shape` objects when passed to the `drawShape` function. The `draw()` method of the appropriate class (either `Circle` or `Square`) is called based on the actual type of the object.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive exploration covers the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Dart. Understanding these concepts, including classes, inheritance, constructors, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism, is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable Dart code.
